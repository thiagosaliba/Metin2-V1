Chunjo Kingdom[ENTER]
[ENTER]
The Chunjo Kingdom is[ENTER]
located in the western part[ENTER]
of the continent. It is a[ENTER]
theocratic kingdom and is[ENTER]
controlled by its spiritual[ENTER]
leaders. It was founded by[ENTER]
Yoon-Young, a cousin of the[ENTER]
former emperor. Yoon's wife[ENTER]
possessed vast magical[ENTER]
powers, and it was she who[ENTER]
discovered the threat of the[ENTER]
Metin Stones and supported[ENTER]
him in his struggle to[ENTER]
[WAIT]
contain it.[ENTER]
Several times he recommended[ENTER]
the initiation of[ENTER]
countermeasures against the[ENTER]
Metin Stones, but he was[ENTER]
always ignored. Thus he led[ENTER]
his fellowship in a[ENTER]
rebellion against the former[ENTER]
empire. After the[ENTER]
disintegration of the former[ENTER]
empire, Chunjo is still[ENTER]
engaged in open warfare with[ENTER]
the Eastern and Southern[ENTER]
kingdoms. Their aim is to[ENTER]
take control of the entire[ENTER]
[WAIT]
continent and to defeat the[ENTER]
growing power of the Metin[ENTER]
Stones.
