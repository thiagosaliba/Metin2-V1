The Boss Reaper Event is for players above level[ENTER]
30. Upon start, boss monsters will appear in the[ENTER]
neutral areas: Valley of Seungryong (Orc[ENTER]
Valley), Mount Sohan (Ice Land), Doyyumhwan[ENTER]
(Fireland) and Yongbi Desert.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
Every attack on a boss monster counts. You can[ENTER]
receive a reward every day, and with at least[ENTER]
one hit, you'll qualify for this daily reward.[ENTER]
The difficulties you face will be proportionate[ENTER]
to your level. Your attack speed will be reduced[ENTER]
by 20% during combat. After killing a boss,[ENTER]
you'll be rewarded with 20% more EXP for 30[ENTER]
minutes.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
Collect your daily reward once you have killed[ENTER]
your first boss by clicking on the event[ENTER]
overview by 23:59 PM. After this time, the[ENTER]
reward will expire. If the boss is still alive[ENTER]
when you leave the map, any hits you earned[ENTER]
there will be forfeit. The boss will then[ENTER]
reappear later at another location. Find him[ENTER]
again to earn some more hits.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
You also have a chance to earn an event reward.[ENTER]
Depending on the number of hits you land, you[ENTER]
will receive a bronze, silver or gold chest.[ENTER]
What counts is your number of hits per boss.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
Collect your reward in town from Mr B. You can[ENTER]
also find out how many hits you've earned from[ENTER]
him.
