Shinsoo Kingdom[ENTER]
[ENTER]
The Shinsoo kingdom is[ENTER]
located in the southern part[ENTER]
of the continent. The main[ENTER]
activity of the population[ENTER]
is trade. Opened after the[ENTER]
disintegration of the former[ENTER]
empire by Yoon-Yoing, trade[ENTER]
with the east quickly became[ENTER]
a profitable arrangement.[ENTER]
Shinsoo has conflicts with[ENTER]
the western kingdom and the[ENTER]
trade road can be dangerous.[ENTER]
When they recognised the[ENTER]
[WAIT]
threat posed by the Metin[ENTER]
Stones, the merchants armed[ENTER]
themselves. Their aim is to[ENTER]
defend themselves against[ENTER]
western attacks, reopen the[ENTER]
trade road and reunite the[ENTER]
former empire under their[ENTER]
Emperor.
