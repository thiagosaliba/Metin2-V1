Off to the Combat Zone![ENTER]
[ENTER]
Are you ready for the ultimate[ENTER]
battle? Then pay a visit to the[ENTER]
Combat Zone Overseer and enter[ENTER]
the Combat Zone.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
Killing enemies will earn you[ENTER]
valuable combat points.[ENTER]
For regular players you receive[ENTER]
1 combat point.[ENTER]
For players who have declared[ENTER]
their retreat from the Combat[ENTER]
Zone, you'll receive 5 combat[ENTER]
points.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
When an event is running in the[ENTER]
Combat Zone, you'll even[ENTER]
receive double the points! Kill[ENTER]
the same player again within 5[ENTER]
minutes, however, and you won't[ENTER]
receive any points.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
If you're successful, you just[ENTER]
need to survive until you can[ENTER]
leave the Combat Zone for your[ENTER]
combat points to be awarded to[ENTER]
you. Once you've announced your[ENTER]
withdrawal from the Combat[ENTER]
Zone, you have to survive 2[ENTER]
more minutes before the points[ENTER]
are credited to you. Afterwards[ENTER]
you can redeem your points from[ENTER]
the Combat Zone Overseer.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
Every time you die, you lose[ENTER]
50% of your points. If you[ENTER]
leave the Combat Zone without[ENTER]
announcing your withdrawal, you[ENTER]
won't get any points. If you[ENTER]
don't have any points, on the[ENTER]
other hand, you can of course[ENTER]
leave the Combat Zone at any[ENTER]
time.[ENTER]

The latest Combat Zone rankings[ENTER]
are reset every Sunday at[ENTER]
midnight. The top 3 players[ENTER]
will be highlighted with a[ENTER]
medal.
