determined by how many sticks land with the flat side facing up.[ENTER]
4. The first throw determines the starting player. The player with the lowest score[ENTER]
begins.[ENTER]
5. Click on 'Throw'. Your move is displayed below. Select the piece you wish to move.[ENTER]
6. If you land directly on a space with an arrow, you can take the shortcut.[ENTER]
